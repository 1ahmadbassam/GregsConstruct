## The Fork
This fork is made exclusively to make an unofficial update to GregBlock to support the currently newest GregTech Community Edition (1.8.0)
The fork was created for the Modded Minecraft Club at: https://www.moddedminecraft.club/

## The Fork (2)
This fork was made based on the work to modernize from GTCE 1.8 / 1.11.3 to latest 1.17. 

Note: I have modified gradlew.bat to point to Java 8 on my system since my Java home is 17. If you want to build this, make sure to change that to the directory of Java 8 on your machine.
